NEW YORK, November 10. --- The Panama Star and Herald of Oct. 31, gives
the following particulars of the insurrection among the blacks of
Jamaica, gleaned from Jamaica papers.

George W. Gordon, of Kingston, the principal mover in the insurrection,
and Paul Bogle have been caught, were being tried by court-martial, with
the Revs. J. H. Cole and James Roach, together with most of the leading
men in the move.

The Maroons of the island have been found to be true and loyal men, and
have done all in their power to save lives and quell the insurrection.

The outrages committed find no parallel. The evidence found upon some of
the prisoners shows the intention of the insurrectionists to spare no
white people but to slaughter all indiscriminately. The rebels will be
dealt with in a most summary way. The leaders having been captured have
dispirited the rebels, and they are surrendering themselves.

The Watchmen office has been closed, and those connected with it have
been arrested on the charges of publishing seditious articles.

H. B. M. storeship Urgent was despatched to Barbadoes for troops, bu no
apprehensions are felt of much further trouble.
