THE VERY LATEST

FROM WASHINGTON, LATE NAVAL ENGAGEMENT

Advices from Morant Bay to the 20th report several rebels condemned to
death, and the complete crushing out of the rebellion. The entire road
from Sang Bay to Morchiornal Bay, eight miles, is strewn so thick with
dead bodies as to render the road impassable.

NEW YORK, Nov. 17. --- The Jamaica correspondent of the Herald gives
full details of the recent naval encounter between the Bulldog and
Voldange, the rebel Haytien steamer, terminating as heretofore reported.

The Russian, French, Belgian, Hamburg, and Ogdensburg Consuls, and fifty
other persons of all nations, were conveyed to the United States steamer
De Soto, Capt. Walker which steamed with them out of danger.

The Bulldog had fired on the town all day, and then begged Capt. Walker
to tow him off. Walker declined any assistance, except to take the
wounded aboard, which was done. One officer and two men were killed, and
fifteen wounded. The people are much exasperated at the conduct of the
British commander.
